# Enhancement_Of_Delegate
C#.Net Core <br>
Problem Statement:<br>
Mahesh has suggested that we should define one function called PerformArithmeticOperation( ) which will take 2 numbers and the Delegate as parameters. Instead of calling / executing the delegate from Main() function, let this function manage the delegate call. You have to implement this functionality.<br>
Hint: The PerformArithmeticOperation() function signature is:<br>
static void PerformArithmeticOperation( int num1, int num2, MyDelegate arOperation){â€¦}
